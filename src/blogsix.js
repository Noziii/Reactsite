          <p>
            In this essay, I will be analysing the AI-generated song titled
            Heart on My Sleeve(2023) by artists Drake and The Weeknd as
            web/internet artwork. But first, let us define the term net/web art.
            According to the writing by Benedetta Ricci ‘internet art’ or ‘web
            art’ can be defined as a type of art specifically made “through the
            internet, on the internet, and for the internet.” (Ricci 2020) Art,
            on the other hand, is defined as a range of human activities which
            result in the production of something that could be creative, has
            imagination, is aesthetically pleasing and might contain
            self-expression. These activities include but are not limited to
            painting, dance, music, and photography. (The Editors of
            Encyclopaedia Britannica 2023)
          </p>
          <p>
            Music as an art form makes use of the combination of vocals and
            instrumental sounds to create something beautiful or as a form of
            emotional expression from the artists. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia
            Britannica, 2023) Let us look at the AI-generated song Heart on My
            Sleeve(2023) by Drake and The Weeknd as art on the internet by the
            internet and for the internet. AI or Artificial Intelligence refers
            to the replication of human intelligence by machines, particularly
            computer systems, examples include the likes of ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa
            etc. For an AI to generate something it must take large amounts of
            data and “learn its patterns” and then produce a few outcomes until
            it generates one that is substantial. (Mage 2022) When it comes to
            music a programmer inputs chords, melodies, and beats into the
            algorithm, learns it, and then produces something based on the data
            that was put in. (Mage, 2022)
          </p>
          <p>
            According to an article by NBC News AI-generated song Heart on My
            Sleeve which replicates the voices of the artists’ Drake and The
            Weeknd was created, written, and released by an anonymous musician
            who goes by the name Ghostwriter. The musician had originally
            recorded the song using their own vocals and then used an AI model
            to replace their vocals with those of Drake and The Weeknd. The song
            was released on all major social media and streaming platforms such
            as YouTube, Spotify, TikTok, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Instagram, and
            Twitter, most of which are profit-generating sites. The song
            immediately went viral with it acquiring 6.9 million views on
            Twitter alone. After a few days, the song was removed from all
            platforms after Universal Music Group (UMG) which represents both
            artists Drake and The Weeknd urged the platforms to take the song
            down as it was a copyright violation. (Fake Drake Song Sparks
            Conversation Over Implications of A.I. Generated Music, 2023)
          </p>
          <p>
            In the writing by Benedetta Ricci, she mentions that web art has its
            own unique features those of which are “connectivity, global reach,
            multimediality, immateriality, interactivity, and equality”. (Ricci
            2020) The AI generated song encompasses specifically the features of
            global reach, immateriality, and connectivity. The song being
            distributed over large internet social platforms allowed it to reach
            all corners of the world at a very fast rate and connect people from
            all over the world through a conversation regarding the song.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music has become immaterial over the years through the progression
            of technology moving from CDs, and cassettes to having music mainly
            based online and available through streaming platforms that function
            using the web. Interactivity is a big part of web/net art and
            interactivity is all about users input and receiving a response but
            such as clicking in the instance of this a simple click of a play
            button is all the interaction the user requires to engage with the
            artwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her writing, Ricci also mentions that artists use their work to
            ‘convey’ messages around social or political issues and create
            discussions and debates around relevant topics or issues. (Ricci
            2020) Although according to the article by NBC News and the
            anonymous artists themselves never made the intention behind the
            artwork clear, it did spark a very relevant debate around the fast
            progression of AI technology and the legal and moral implications
            surrounding its use, especially regarding this work. After the song
            was released a large debate around AI technology took place across
            all social media platforms regarding the negative implications such
            creations might have on society, the artists that have been
            implicated, the music industry, and the legality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The debate raised issues on how a creation such as this song
            infringes on the rights of the artists whose voices are being used
            to sell work that is not their own and someone else makes a profit
            off their voices. Brought into the discussion was another
            AI-generated song using the voice of rapper, singer, and songwriter
            Kanye West alongside Drake as well as a deep fake music video to
            accompany the song performing the song of another artist who goes by
            the name Ice Spice. This then points to the topics of uniqueness
            (aura) and authorship brought up by Walter Benjamin in his essay The
            Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935) which
            discusses the cheapening that mass production causes to the
            uniqueness of artworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remanufacturing of artwork causes it to lose its uniqueness the
            ghostwriter wrote the song initially for themself but chose to
            regenerate using other artists’ voices taking away the authenticity
            that comes with creating music and losing the personal and emotional
            expression that comes from the artist, through the creation of the
            music as Walter Benjamin calls it the aura. (Benjamin 1935) The loss
            of aura and uniqueness is also caused by the process of automation
            that most web artworks fall into. Automation is the use of
            technology to complete tasks with little human contribution.
            (“Definition of Automation,” n.d.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This then turned to the bigger issue of how this form of net artwork
            (AI generated) raises moral and legal issues while also infringing
            on the rights of the artists. Due to the music of artists of high
            caliber such as Drake and The Weeknd being copyrighted, it makes it
            illegal to use their music to ‘train’ AIs to replicate what they do.
            This also affects the artists themselves because the work is being
            used against their will infringing on their right to control the
            profitable use of their work. Media lawyer and managing partner
            commented on the NBC news that they were awaiting the court’s
            decision to decide whether or not it is okay for copyrighted music
            to be used to train AIs, but because it makes use of pre-existing
            songs to create a new song. The court might rule that it is not a
            copyright infringement because it’s ‘transformative’. (Fake Drake

            2023)
          </p>
          <p>
            Net art has been dubbed as a unique form of artwork being set aside
            from works such as paintings and sculptures but rather it opens
            doors to endless possibilities for digital creations and has had
            people debating on exactly what makes the work qualify as art, how
            one preserve or collect and show this form of artwork. (Dean 2019)
            In the likeness of this kind of artwork which is displayed purely
            through the support of the web having been created through an AI
            that is heavily reliant on the Internet. And is stored on the
            internet or can evenly be stored traditionally by downloading and
            saving the song on a drive or recording. This artwork then falls
            perfectly into the categories of art on the internet art, for the
            internet, and by the internet. Produced with the intention to be
            distributed on the web. And created by the internet through AI and
            is on the internet currently or was before it was ‘taken down’. In
            this case, the medium of the artwork is the internet as it was
            created through an AI and the only real way this work will survive
            as an internet art is through the internet due to the features that
            make up internet artworks that are mentioned in the beginning.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose that artwork because it interested me on a technical and
            aesthetic level. I truly wanted to understand how this form of work
            was created which I found impressive, scary, and morally and
            ethically wrong. Me being part of the few people who listened to the
            song and participated in the worldwide social media debate regarding
            the song and the anonymous artist who created and released it. I am
            ashamed to say that the song itself was good, and I would have added
            it to my music had it not been taken down. The artwork causes a blur
            in the lines of legality copyright protects artists from having
            their work used by other people but where do you draw the line at
            someone using and replicating your voice for their own work?{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            This kind of web artwork has the potential to be dangerous in
            potentially having the ability to render artists obsolete when AIs
            can now just use their voices to create new music this also benefits
            bigger companies such as record labels in terms of profit where they
            no longer need to wait for artists to write songs or pay them when
            an AI now has the ability to do what they can do and audiences will
            still listen to the songs as long as they sound good. Record labels
            will have the ability to just mass produce music. All the artists
            have left to do is perform the songs live when needed. The
            AI-generated song as an artwork I think is a successful artwork
            because it does what any good artwork should do stir emotions in its
            audiences and ignite conversation.

            Although there is no accompanying music video to the song my
            aesthetic appeal to it was in the beauty of how it sounds. As
            brilliant as this form of web art is it takes away from other
            artists’ rights. But that doesn’t seem to stop the anonymous
            musician ghostwriter as they made it clear that they are not done
            and will be back because “you cannot kill a ghost”. (Fake Drake Song

          <p>
            Web art is not an easy term to coin because, from observation and
            research, it is hard to categorize what is and isn’t web art. But
            web art seems to be an artwork that was created with the intention
            of being displayed on the internet, through the internet, and for
            the internet. (Ricci 2020) Web art opens an endless door of digital
            creative possibilities, but it starts to become extremely difficult
            when you encounter works such as this one whereas of right now the
            artwork is basically illegal and can potentially open the door to
            the destruction of an entire component of the art world along with
            its artists.
